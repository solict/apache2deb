<IfModule proxy_module>
#
# This module implements a proxy/gateway for Apache. It implements proxying
# capability for AJP13 (Apache JServe Protocol version 1.3), FTP, CONNECT
# (for SSL), HTTP/0.9, HTTP/1.0, and HTTP/1.1. The module can be configured
# to connect to other proxy modules for these and other protocols.
#

# If you want to use apache2 as a forward proxy, uncomment the
# 'ProxyRequests On' line and the <Proxy *> block below.
# WARNING: Be careful to restrict access inside the <Proxy *> block.
# Open proxy servers are dangerous both to your network and to the
# Internet at large.
#
# If you only want to use apache2 as a reverse proxy/gateway in
# front of some web application server, you DON'T need
# 'ProxyRequests On'.

#ProxyRequests On
#<Proxy *>
#    AddDefaultCharset off
#    Order deny,allow
#    Deny from all
#    #Allow from .example.com
#</Proxy>

# Enable/disable the handling of HTTP/1.1 "Via:" headers.
# ("Full" adds the server version; "Block" removes all outgoing Via: headers)
# Set to one of: Off | On | Full | Block
#ProxyVia Off
