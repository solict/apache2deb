<IfModule status_module>
#
# The Status module allows a server administrator to find out how well their
# server is performing. A HTML page is presented that gives the current server
# statistics in an easily readable form. If required this page can be made to
# automatically refresh (given a compatible browser). Another page gives a
# simple machine-readable list of the current server state.
#

#
# Allow server status reports generated by mod_status,
# with the URL of http://servername/server-status
# Uncomment and change the "192.0.2.0/24" to allow access from other hosts.
