#
# This module is used by default instead of mod_cgi whenever a multi-threaded
# MPM is selected during the compilation process. At the user level, this
# module is identical in configuration and operation to mod_cgi. The only
# exception is the additional directive ScriptSock which gives the name of
# the socket to use for communication with the cgi daemon.
