#
# The CGI (Common Gateway Interface) defines a way for a web server to interact
# with external content-generating programs, which are often referred to as CGI
# programs or CGI scripts. It is the simplest, and most common, way to put
# dynamic content on your web site.
#

#
# This block enables global CGI support by defining a cgi-bin directory
# for scripts.
#
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /var/www/cgi-bin/
<Directory "/var/www/cgi-bin">
    AllowOverride None
    #AllowOverride AuthConfig FileInfo
    Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
    #Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews +FollowSymLinks
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>

#
# To enable CGI scripting you will need to add ExecCGI to each virtual host.
# Example for default virtual host:
#
#<Directory /var/www/html/>
#    AllowOverride All
#    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks -MultiViews +ExecCGI
#    Order allow,deny
#    Allow from All
#</Directory>
