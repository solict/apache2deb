<IfModule suexec_module>
#
# This module, in combination with the suexec support program allows
# CGI scripts to run as a specified user and Group.
#
# Directives should only be set on a per vhost basis and not be put
# on this file.

# to enable privilege separation, add a "SuexecUserGroup" directive
# and chown the cgi wrapper script and parent directory accordingly.
# the core "User" and "Group" directives should not be used for this.
</IfModule>
