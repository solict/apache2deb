#
# mod_disk_cache implements a disk based storage manager. It is primarily of
# use in conjunction with mod_cache.
# Content is stored in and retrieved from the cache using URI based keys.
# Content with access protection is not cached.
#
# Cache cleaning is done by htcacheclean, which can be configured in
# /etc/apache22deb/envvars
#
# For further information, see the comments in that file, 
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/>, and the htcacheclean(8)
# man page.
#

# This path must be the same as the one in /etc/apache22deb/envvars
CacheRoot ${APACHE_CACHE_DIR}/mod_disk_cache

# This will also cache local documents. It usually makes more sense to
# put this into the configuration for just one virtual host.

# The result of CacheDirLevels * CacheDirLength must not be higher than
# 20. Moreover, pay attention on file system limits. Some file systems
# do not support more than a certain number of subdirectories in a
# single directory (e.g. 32000 for ext3)
