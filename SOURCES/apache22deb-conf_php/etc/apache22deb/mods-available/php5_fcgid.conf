# It is activated by enabling this pseudo-module and mod_fcgid
# and then passing the argument php5_fcgid to apache at startup.

# To enable privilege separation, add a mod_suexec "SuexecUserGroup" directive
# to your vhost and chown the CGI wrapper script and parent directory accordingly.
#
# Finally, you will need to add and adapt for your vhost the following:
# - the "FcgidWrapper" directive, which replaces actions and alias
# - the FilesMatch and Location configuration blocks (optionally)
# Note: Copy and adjust the CGI wrapper script path accordingly.

# Command to be used to spawn FCGI server processes
FcgidWrapper /var/www/cgi-bin/php5-fcgid .php

# Be careful to adjust the parameters accordingly to your requirements:
# - FcgidIOTimeout: Timeout for communication (affects PHP max_execution_time)
#     (see IOTimeout in FcgidCmdOptions)
# - FcgidBusyTimeout: Timeout for busy requests (affects PHP max_execution_time)
# - FcgidIdleTimeout: Timeout for iddle requests (affects PHP op caching)
#     (see IdleTimeout in FcgidCmdOptions)
# - FcgidMaxRequestsPerProcess: Maximum requests handled by each process
#     (must be the same or less than PHP_FCGI_MAX_REQUESTS in FcgidWrapper)
#     (see MaxRequestsPerProcess in FcgidCmdOptions)
# These are overriden by FcgidCmdOptions.

# Set processing options for the FastCGI command (affects PHP execution)
FcgidCmdOptions /var/www/cgi-bin/php5-fcgid \
  IOTimeout 30 \
  MaxRequestsPerProcess 1000

# Maximum HTTP request length in bytes (affects PHP post_max_size)
FcgidMaxRequestLen 8388608

# Header name which will be passed to FastCGI as environment variable
FcgidPassHeader none

# Fix the Pathinfo passed to FastCGI server (must match PHP cgi.fix_pathinfo)
FcgidFixPathinfo 0
