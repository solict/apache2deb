# This is the Apache server configuration file for providing FastCGI support
# through mod_fcgid.
#
# Documentation is available at
# http://httpd.apache.org/mod_fcgid/mod/mod_fcgid.html
#

# WARNING: this is a kludge:
## The User/Group for apache22deb need to be set before we can load mod_fastcgi,
## but /etc/apache22deb/conf.d/fastcgi.conf on CentOS gets loaded before
## /etc/apache22deb/apache2.conf, so we need to set them here :(
## mod_fcgid does not have this bug,
## but it does not handle child PHP processes appropriately per
## http://serverfault.com/questions/303535/a-single-php-fastcgi-process-blocks-all-other-php-requests/305093#305093
